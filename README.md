# trello-json-viewer
Web UI for reading Trello's JSON archives

To use:

1. Place your trello.json export in the same directory as index.html
2. Browse to index.html

Doing this from a local folder doesn't work in Chrome but does work in Firefox, otherwise host it through a server.

There are likely to be many issues, feel free to help or log issues.
